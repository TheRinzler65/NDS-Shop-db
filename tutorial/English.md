## Notes

- The download speed is limited to `45 KB/s`, which means a `30 MB` file will take approximately `10 minutes` to download, or possibly a bit longer.

- By default, ROMs are placed in the `sdmc:/roms/nds/` folder on the SD card to be launched directly from TWiLight Menu.

- By default, boxarts are placed in the `sdmc:/_nds/TWiLight-Menu/boxart` folder on the SD card so they can be displayed in TWiLight Menu before launching the game.


## Game Requests

- Not all games are available yet, but you can request them on our Discord (not available yet).
