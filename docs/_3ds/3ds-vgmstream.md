update_notes: '<p dir="auto">New:<br>

  Now uses dsp over csnd, this grants all of the benefits of dsp, better streaming.  This
  does however require users to dump their dsp firmware (see <a href="https://github.com/Cruel/DspDump">dsp
  dumper</a>)</p>

  <p dir="auto">Fixed:<br>

  Various other fixes, such as the sound being garbled if you play multiple songs
  in a single session.</p>'
