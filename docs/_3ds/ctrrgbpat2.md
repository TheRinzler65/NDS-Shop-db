update_notes: '<p dir="auto">Hey ! I''m not dead ! :D</p>

  <p dir="auto">Anyway here''s what''s new :</p>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>I''m on the Universal updater ! Yipeeeeee !</li>

  <li>Fixed crash of force exit of the app (finally, i knew those std::strings were
  evil)</li>

  <li>Also you can now go back to the HOME menu again if you want</li>

  <li>Fixed a few visual glitches</li>

  <li>The unknown pattern is now known : it triggers when you boot your DS or you
  exit sleep mode (can make for some cool transitions)</li>

  </ul>

  <p dir="auto">The roadmap also has been updated with some ideas from Semka (thx)</p>

  <p dir="auto">I''m definitely not done with this yet, i still have a few things
  i want to implement but also i don''t have the time. This is kind of like a fun
  project so please don''t mind the unfrequent updates, thank you</p>

  <p dir="auto">Have fun ! :)</p>

# CtrRGBPAT2
This 3DS application allows the LED color to be changed. In order for this to work, Luma CFW (custom firmware) needs to be installed.
Thanks to [CPunch](https://github.com/CPunch/CtrRGBPATTY/) for the original project !

## Features
Customize the LED color and pattern for when you receive notifications ! Whether SpotPass, StreetPass, online Friends, or more (Yes, there's more) ! Why keep the default blue when you can have a cool-looking purple for example ðŸ˜Ž

Everything is simple and made so you cannot possibly screw something up (or else you really wanted to)

## Upcoming
- Save and restore feature
- Proper UI ?

Hope you enjoy ! :)
