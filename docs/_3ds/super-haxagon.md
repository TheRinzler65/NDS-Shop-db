  <h3>About this build:</h3>

  <p>Most systems haven''t significantly changed across platforms. All have been tested
  on hardware. This is primarily a release for the TI-Nspire but I''ll upload new
  builds here to keep them up to date.</p>

  <p>As for the TI-Nspire build the credits and beatmaps are not currently working.</p>

  <h3>A summary:</h3>

  <p>I''ve finally come back to what started my programming adventure. A simple app
  for a calculator. In 2013 I released the program "Super Hexaspire" as an alpha.
  At the time I had no idea that programming would turn into a career.</p>

  <p>So here we are today, porting a game around to so many different platforms. Starting
  with the Nspire, moving to the 3DS, then to PC, then to the Switch, and finally
  back to the Nspire. Super Haxagon has been quite a project over the years and taught
  me many things about technology, and for that I am grateful.</p>
