# NDS-Shop-db
> An online database of DS games in Universal-Updater

## Information

I am partially affiliated with Universal-Updater because we use their program to create this store. I decided to develop this store to allow users to download European Nintendo DS games directly to their consoles, enabling them to enjoy multilingual gameplay. I want to respect and acknowledge the work of the Universal-Updater team, and I thank them for giving us the opportunity to create our own Unistore. All the necessary information is explained in detail on their [Wiki](https://github.com/Universal-Team/Universal-Updater/wiki) and [Universal-Updater database](https://github.com/Universal-Team/db).


**I don't recommend using my repository, as I've modified a few lines of code for my own Unistore. Instead, please use the official repository from the [Universal-Updater database](https://github.com/Universal-Team/db).**
